Predicting Loan Defaults in the Banking Sector
Introduction:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on historical data from a German bank. The bank faces challenges with loan defaulters, and this project aims to address this issue by exploring the available data and developing a model to predict default status.

Project Structure:
The project is organized into the following files and components:

Report (PDF):
The PDF file contains a comprehensive report detailing the entire project, including the introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion.
It includes visualizations and a detailed explanation of the analysis and findings.

Solution Code (IPYNB):
The Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB) file contains the code for the entire project.
It includes data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing, as well as the implementation of various machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
The notebook is well-documented and organized into sections based on the project workflow.

HTML File(.html):
The HTML file is an exported version of the IPYNB file.
It provides a static, view-only version of the Jupyter Notebook with the code, outputs, and visualizations.

Interpretation:
Refer to the PDF report for detailed interpretation and findings from the analysis.

Additional Information:
Documentation: The code is well-documented with comments and explanations.

This project aims to provide insights into the loan default prediction in the banking sector and offer potential improvements for the bank's loan management strategy.
